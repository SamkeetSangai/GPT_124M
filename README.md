- **Number of Layers:** `12`
- **Number of Attention Heads:** `12`
- **Embedding Size:** `768`
- **Hardware:** `8x NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs`
- **Training Duration:** `13 hours`
- **Dataset:** `fineweb-edu` (10 billion tokens)
- **Training Date:** `January 2025`
- **Validation Dataset:** 100 million tokens of HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu
  
## Usage
You can use this model for text generation using the `transformers` library.

### Method 1: Using Pipeline
```python
# Import necessary modules from transformers
from transformers import pipeline, AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load tokenizer and model
model_name = "samkeet/GPT_124M"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)

# Create text generation pipeline
pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model=model_name, tokenizer=tokenizer, trust_remote_code=True, device="cpu")

# Generate text
result = pipe("Earth revolves around the", do_sample=True, max_length=40, temperature=0.9, top_p=0.5, top_k=50)
print("Pipeline Output:", result)
```

### Method 1: Direct Generation
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import torch

# Function for direct tokenization and text generation
def generate_text(input_text, device='cpu'):
    tokens = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors='pt').to(device)
    model.to(device)
    
    # Generate output
    output = model.generate(
        tokens, 
        do_sample=True, 
        max_length=40, 
        temperature=0.9,
        top_p=0.5,
        top_k=50,
    )
    
    # Decode generated text
    generated_sentence = tokenizer.decode(output)
    return generated_sentence

# Generate text
input_text = "Earth revolves around the"
print("Direct Output:", generate_text(input_text))
```

### Fine-tuning & Downstream Use
This model can be fine-tuned for specific NLP applications like:
- Dialogue generation
- Text summarization
- Creative writing
- Code generation

## Limitations & Risks

### Out-of-Scope Use
- The model is **not instruction-tuned** for safety, ethics, or factual accuracy.
- It may produce **biased, misleading, or unsafe outputs**.
- It should **not** be used for tasks requiring high reliability, such as medical, legal, or financial applications.

### Bias, Risks, and Limitations
- The dataset may contain biases present in public web data.
- The model does not filter or detect offensive content.
- The model may **hallucinate** incorrect facts.

### Recommendations
- Always **verify** generated content before use.
- Implement **content filtering mechanisms** for deployment.
- Use in supervised environments only.

## Evaluation

### Training & Validation Loss
Validation was conducted using `100 million tokens` from the `HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu` dataset. The training and validation loss graph indicates a stable convergence with minimal overfitting. The training loss achieved a minimum value of 2.88, while the validation loss stabilized at 2.97.

### Results
The model was benchmarked against OpenAIâ€™s GPT-2 Small and GPT-3 Small (both ~124M parameters). Remarkably, despite being trained on only `10 billion tokens`, compared to GPT-3 Small's `300 billion tokens`, GPT-124M was able to outperform both models in `HellaSwag` evaluation. This performance advantage is attributed to the specialized training data (educational content), which contrasts with GPT-3 Smallâ€™s broader multilingual and multi-domain training data.

According to Chinchillaâ€™s scaling laws, an optimal token-to-parameter ratio suggests that a 124M-parameter model ideally requires `2.48 billion tokens` for training. The excess training tokens used in GPT-3 Small might have led to diminishing returns in performance.

### Key Insights from Evaluation
- **Efficient Training:** The model demonstrates impressive performance relative to its training token count, suggesting an efficient use of resources due to training using the Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) technique.
- **Data-Specific Advantage:** Training exclusively on educational data may have given GPT-124M an edge in evaluation metrics like `HellaSwag`.
- **Scaling Considerations:** GPT-3 Small, despite being trained on 300B tokens, does not exhibit proportionally better performance due to scaling limitations.

## Environmental Impact

- **Hardware Used:** `8x NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs`
- **Training Time:** `13 hours -> 104 GPU hours`
- **Estimated Carbon Emissions:** `13.48 kg CO2 eq.`
- **Equivalent to:**
  - `54.5 km` driven by an average ICE car
  - `6.75 kg` of coal burned
  - `0.22` tree seedlings sequestering carbon for 10 years

## Technical Specifications

### Model Architecture
GPT-124M follows the architecture of OpenAI's GPT-2, which consists of:
- **Transformer-based decoder model**
- **Self-attention mechanism**
- **Layer normalization & feed-forward networks**

### Compute Infrastructure
